# prml-projects
this repository consists of three projects:
1. Conducted a comprehensive analysis on the Digits dataset of sklearn using k-Nearest Neighbors and PCA preprocessing coded from scratch, evaluated the impact of Gaussian noise, and reported performance metrics for raw, PCA-transformed, noisy, and PCA-transformed noisy data.
2. Developed and optimized a Random Forest classifier from scratch, determining the optimal number of trees through validation, and reported training and test errors across four classification datasets, with visualizations for synthetic 2D datasets.
3. Derived and evaluated Multiclass Bayes Classifiers with different assumptions on variances, implemented them on two given datasets, and analyzed performance using a 4x4 loss matrix and confusion matrices, along with visualizing classifiers in 2D plots.
